Timing Constraint Annotation
============================

Overview
--------

Splash offers timing semantics for specifying the time constraints for real-time stream processing. Splash supports four timing constraints: (1) freshness constraint, (2) correlation constraint, (3) latency constraint and (4) rate constraint.

1. Freshness Constraint
-----------------------

The freshness constraint is the time at which a given stream data element is valid after the data element is generated. It is annotated on a port.

For a port :math:`p`, let :math:`S_p` denotes a set of sources used to produce a data element for :math:`p`.

2. Correlation Constraint
-------------------------

3. Latency Constraint
---------------------

4. Rate Constraint
------------------
